I’m so excited that you’re taking the next steps towards your health and fitness journey! I was raised in Memphis, Tennessee and I started my fitness journey around January 2019. Before I started working out, I didn’t know what it meant to love yourself and to take care your body. I stumbled across the 1 Corinthians 6:19 and that verse changed my life on how I should take care of my body. My body is a temple that God created to give Him honor and I wanna pass that passion and knowledge to others. My mission is YOU! I’m looking forward to seeing what God will do to you and through you as we walk together in this journey together!

					<strong>1 Corinthians <span className="secondary-text">6:19-20</span> TPT</strong>
					<br/>
					Your body is now the sacred temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who lives in you. You don’t belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary. You were God’s expensive purchase, paid for with tears of blood, so by all means, then, use your body to bring glory to God!
